# 🧵 Smart Quality Monitoring Dashboard

This project simulates a real-world quality control system in a manufacturing environment. Using synthetic data generated with Python, I designed a Power BI dashboard to help factories monitor product defects, machine performance, and operator activity through dynamic KPIs and clear visualizations.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **Total inspections**
- **Rejection rate (%)**
- **Top defect type**
- **Machine with most defects**
- **Rejection rate by machine**
- **Most common defects**
- **Inspections by operator**
- **Interactive filters:** Machine, Operator, Date range

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python (data simulation & analysis)
- Power BI (dashboard design)
- DAX (custom KPIs)
- Pandas, Matplotlib
- Excel / CSV data handling
